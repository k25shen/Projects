# Projects
Some school and extracurricular projects I worked on

Bitcoin price prediction
  Use LSTM to predict bitcoin price and use 20-point moving average as the benchmark
  
Fraud Detection:
  Did EDA on a trasnaction dataset and then built a adaboost model to predict the fraudualent activities
 
House Pricing Prediction:
  Using house price dataset from kaggleto build a xgboost model to predict house pricing and achieved top 15% on the leader boards

Heat Failure Prediction:
  Used a heart failure clinical data from kaggle to build a classification model, using lgboost, logistic regression, random forest and a simple ensemble technique. The final results are 88% accuracy and 0.79 f1 score.
